# Microservice - Book of the day
This section of the microservice is designed to generate a randomized book that will be integrated into a library-like application with similarities to Goodreads. Through the use of a hyperlink, the microservice will interface with the application's code. It was agreed upon by both parties that utilizing the school's VPN and flip servers would be the most efficient means of project completion. The microservice's function is to randomly select a book from a pre-established list of tuples and subsequently display pertinent information regarding the book's title, author, and rating to the user.
